# Media Consent Form

This is the form for students to grant media consent for our events, so we can take pictures and record video at will.


## Making a form

You must have `pdflatex`, `make`, and either `svg2pdf` or `inkscape` installed.

Simply run:

    make

to make the form. It will appear as `form.pdf` if everything goes well
